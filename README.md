## PROBLEM STATEMENT
A general statement of face recognition problem can be formulated  given still orÂ video images of a scene, identify or verify one or more persons in the scene using a stored database of faces with their present actively location.

## FACE DETECTION
Face recognition presents a challenging problem in the field of image analysis and computer vision. The security of information is becoming very significant and difficult. Security cameras are presently common in airports, Offices, University, ATM, Bank and Traffic Signals etc. with a security system. Face recognition is a biometric system used to identify or verify a person from a digital image. Face Recognition system is used in security. Face recognition system should be able to automatically detect a face in an image. This involves extracts its features and then recognize it, regardless of lighting, expression, illumination, ageing, transformations (translate, rotate and scale image) and pose, which is a difficult task.

## FACE VERIFICATION
Face verification, also often referred to as face authentication, is about validating an identity based on the image of a face by checking against an existing database.
Face authentication involves comparing an input image only with the image that belongs to the identity the person claims to be. In other words, the system will only compare your face to one picture, not the whole database
